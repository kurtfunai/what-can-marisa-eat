This is actually the reason that she has most of the other allergies listed here (tree nuts, etc). Certain raw fruits and veggies cause her to have a mild allergic reaction. Don't worry about hiding these away, but just know that she may avoid them. I cannot even keep track of which ones cause this. I think celery and apples?" }
